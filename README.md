BETA_LHC_SIMULATOR
===============

An ultra-basic Large Hadron Collider (LHC) simulator written in C. Created by Carlos Ciller on Oct-2012.

The aim of this program is to provide an application partially simulating the behaviour of a "Large Hadron Collider".

Since I don't want to exactly monitor how the LHC works, I will improvise and adapt the program and its behaviour to show different resources of the C Programming language.								

Most of the information from within we developed this simulator may be located at the following links:

All of these calculus where both a combination of extracted information and my own work. No one has yet revised them, but I expect they me be close to reality ;)!
